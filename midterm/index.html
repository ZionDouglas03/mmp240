        <P>A sequel to the series "Power." On his own for the first time, Tariq St. Patrick Tariq navigates his new life, 
            in which his desire to shed his father's legacy comes up against the mounting pressure to save his family; 
            along the way, Tariq gets entangled in the affairs of the cutthroat Tejada family, adding further complications as he 
            tries to balance his drug operations with his education, love life, family affairs, and mounting pressure; he divides 
            his time between school and hustling to pay for his mother's defense attorney, 
            but when he runs out of options, Tariq turns to a familiar drug game.</P>
